Background 
------------------
covidschoolscanadaORG/CovidSchoolScraper: downloads daily snapshots of school board tables.
Target dir: covidschoolscanada Google drive / SchoolBoard_daily_snapshot

Code and workflow
------------------
Code flow at present. Work very much in progress as of 2020-09-24:

Master shell script: mergeMaster.sh
Runs update collector for all school boards in turn. Currently hard-coded for debugging. 

findNewRecords.R - compares current to last snapshot (1700 EDT daily) and
collects records with differences.

annotNewRecords.R - converts the new records into the csv format needed
for the Google map. Uses Ontario school lat/long info to auto-populate
those fields and adds entries for other fields found in Google map

Note on args: Each school has two args associated with it:
1) the folder name (no spaces) : e.g. "Toronto_DSB"
2) name of school board: must match school board name in Ontario-wide
list of lat/long

Files required
-----------------
ONnew_sif_data_table_2018_2019prelim_en_august.tsv - list of Ontario schools,
school boards, with lat/long info. ** Needs to be manually updated when
there is a school name mismatch between it and the list from the DSB
website. Process to do this is:
1) open tsv in Google sheets
2) make changes
3) download as new tsv
4) update link in annotNewRecords.R
