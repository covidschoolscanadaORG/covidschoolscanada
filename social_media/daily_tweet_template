We ask for e-mail addresses in case we need to contact you to verify info (e.g. get letter from school or PHU). 

We don't mention your email address in the posted case (anonymous tip), and we do NOT sell your email address. 

We just want 100% transparency in our schools.

Today's notes: 📝 

1) We have 8 extra points for QC that we are working with @CovidEcoles
 to resolve.

2) Coming soon: FAQ page, school board + PHU info, data tables for public use.

3) There will be no update on Sunday, as our volunteers take a break!

Stay tuned!
