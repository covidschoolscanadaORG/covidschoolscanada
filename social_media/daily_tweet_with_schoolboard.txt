We ask for e-mail addresses in case we need to contact you to verify info (e.g. get letter from school or PHU). 

We don't mention your email address in the posted case (anonymous tip), and we do NOT sell your email address. 

We just want 100% transparency in our schools.

Today's notes: 📝 
1) We had 10 duplicate points in the Ottawa catholic schools yesterday; those are resolved.

2) FAQ, data table imminent! Just juggling daily updates and getting all these other pieces in.

Stay safe out there!
