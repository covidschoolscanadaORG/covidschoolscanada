# COVID Schools Canada Data Collection Method

COVID-19 cases and outbreaks were collected from school board websites, Provincial Public Health Unit (PHU) websites, and letters sent by PHU and schools to families. Provinces varied in the extent to which their data were made publicly available in centralized locations, so our data collection varied according to that. Cases were categorized as being either single/unlinked cases, outbreaks, or clusters. For all Provinces except Québec, outbreak designations were only assigned in cases where the corresponding PHU called the incident an outbreak. For Québec, where the Provincial government did not define school outbreaks, any school with 5+ cases was deemed to have an outbreak. 
* Ontario: Ontario mandated reporting of all COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on school board websites. These data were automatically scraped for X larger school boards and were manually collected from smaller school board websites [ ADD link to websites ]
